# PhinaJS Sample Games
Phina.JS is one of Game Engine based on JavaScript. I had tried to create some games on 2D based. These games are puzzle type and maze type.
## Description:
This is one of tutrial for creating some games based on phina.js. In this document, to try creating 2D based breakout games with pazzle and maze. 
## Demo:
I will explain to create 2D based games of pazzle type step by step. In these games, some walking graphics are downloaded from  [pikasgame](https://dorapika.wixsite.com/pikasgame) and [pipoya](http://blog.pipoya.net/).

### Step-1
As a first step, let's try to display a static character's graphic at center of window.

### Step-3
At the Step-3, try to display a active character's graphic at center of window.

### Step-5
At the Step-5, display tiles of walls and boxes. Then, to set the limit of walking at walls.

### Step-6
At the Step-6, to set pushing a box. It is finished the basic 2D based game sample.

### Step-7
In this step, try to create game for 2D type of maze with small chang of the sample in Step-6. The algorithm for making maze is based on [Algoful](http://algoful.com/Archive/Algorithm/MazeDig).

### Step-8
At the Step-8, added some enemies to the sample in Step-6.
